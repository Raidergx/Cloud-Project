# Cloud-Project
Project to build my cloud and coding abilities and learn IaC

This project is a culmination of my skills to showcase prowess and express my knowledge in AWS, Python, Java, Terraform, HTML, and CSS. I will continue to update and improve upon this project overtime.

# Step 1: HTML & CSS

In this step I lay out the groundworks for the resume I will be hosting on my website. The resume is built with HTML and then styled with CSS to keep things simplified for now. 

# Step 2: AWS account creation

In this step I:
  -created AWS Account
  -enabled MFA on root account
  -created new-user account and gave it permissions needed
  -deleted access key on root account
  -created access key on new-user account
  -installed aws-vault
  -saved new-user credentials to aws-vault

  # Step 3: Terraform Initialization
